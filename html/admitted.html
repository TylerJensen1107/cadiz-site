<h2>Visa Application Process</h2>
    <p>All students who take part in the NW CÃ¡diz program are required to obtain a Spanish Visa prior to leaving the
        US. <br/>More details about this will be given at the required orientations for the program (you will receive
        emails about these orientations after being admitted to the program). <br/> IMPORTANT: You do NOT need to make
        an individual appointment with the consulate. Suzanne Petersen will take all student visa applications down to
        the San Francisco consulate at once.</p>
