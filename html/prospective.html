	<h1>Apply Now</h1>
	<p>A limited number of early admissions will be granted to exceptionally qualified applicants before the published application deadline. For this reason, early submission of applications is permitted and even encouraged. In the event that more qualified students apply for a given semester than can be accepted, please keep in mind that among the several criteria used to determine admission, in general, priority is given to year-long over single semester students and to more advanced students over those less advanced (in Spanish).</p>
