    <h1>Welcome to the NW Cádiz Program</h1>

    <h2>Program Introduction</h2>
    <h3>The NW CÁDIZ program offers American students the opportunity to live and study in Cádiz, Spain, for one
        semester or a full academic year. Administered by the University of Washington, this study-abroad program
        operates under a formal working agreement with the University of Cádiz. It is the only full-year American
        study-abroad program located in Cádiz. Students live with a private family and attend classes at the University
        of Cádiz's Facultad de Filosofía y Letras. NW CÁDIZ courses are especially designed for the program's students
        and are taught in Spanish by members of the University of Cádiz faculty.
